# 🧠 SecondBrain

**SecondBrain** is a full-stack web application designed to serve as your personal knowledge repository — a place to preserve and organize important posts or content you want to keep for future reference.

Built with MERN stack, it provides a clean, responsive user interface and a backend for storing, retrieving, and managing posts.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 **Save & Store Posts:** Archive important content and links that matter to you.
- 🗃️ **Categorization:** Easily categorize and browse saved posts by type (e.g., article, video, tweet, etc.). A convenient filter in the sidebar allows you to view only specific types of content like Tweets, Videos, or Instagram Posts.
- 🔗 **Share Brain**: Create a unique shareable link (with a secure hash) to share your entire SecondBrain in view-only mode. Recipients can access and browse all your saved posts without needing to log in, but cannot modify or delete any content. The shared view preserves all original UI/UX features like filtering, categorization, and modal post views.
- 🔃 **Sort Feature:** Allows user to sort posts based on the time they were created in actual or reverse order.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes—from mobile to desktop. The sidebar collapses gracefully on smaller screens, and the layout dynamically adjusts the number of cards displayed per row to optimize readability.
- 📝 **Modal View for Details:** View post details in a dedicated modal.
- ♻️ **Refresh Mechanism:** Instantly reflect changes without page reloads.
- 🔍 **Search (Planned):** Quickly find the post you’re looking for.
