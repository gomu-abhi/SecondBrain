# 🧠 SecondBrain

**SecondBrain** is a full-stack web application designed to serve as your personal knowledge repository — a place to preserve and organize important posts or content you want to keep for future reference.

Built with MERN stack, it provides a clean, responsive user interface and a backend for storing, retrieving, and managing posts.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 **Save & Store Posts:** Archive important content and links that matter to you.
- 🗃️ **Categorization:** Easily categorize and browse saved posts by type (e.g., article, video, tweet, etc.). A convenient filter in the sidebar allows you to view only specific types of content like Tweets, Videos, or Instagram Posts.
- 🔗 **Share Brain**: Create a unique shareable link (with a secure hash) to share your entire SecondBrain in view-only mode. Recipients can access and browse all your saved posts without needing to log in, but cannot modify or delete any content. The shared view preserves all original UI/UX features like filtering, categorization, and modal post views.
- 🔍 **Search (Planned):** Quickly find the post you’re looking for.
- 📝 **Modal View for Details:** View post details in a dedicated modal.
- ♻️ **Refresh Mechanism:** Instantly reflect changes without page reloads.
